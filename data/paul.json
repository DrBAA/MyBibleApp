    "birth_and_background": "Paul, originally known as Saul, was born in Tarsus, an ancient city located in what is now modern-day Turkey. A Roman citizen by birth, Paul was educated as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisee\" target=\"_blank\">Pharisee</a> under the famous teacher Gamaliel. Initially a persecutor of Christians, his life dramatically changed after his conversion on the road to Damascus, which is an ancient city located in the region of modern-day Syria.<br><br>As he neared Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly shone around him, and he fell to the ground, unable to see. He heard a voice saying, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?' Saul asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' The voice replied, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.' Blinded by the light, Saul was led by his companions into Damascus. There, for three days, he was without sight and did not eat or drink (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+9%3A3-19&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Acts 9:3-9</a>).<br><br>Ananias, a disciple in Damascus, received a vision from the Lord instructing him to go to Saul. <br>Ananias went to the house, laid his hands on Saul, and said, 'Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.' Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again after which he was baptized. This transformative event led him to become a devoted follower of Christ, changing his name from Saul to Paul (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+9%3A10-19&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Acts 9:10-19</a>).<br><br>Throughout his ministry, Paul faced numerous threats and plots on his life. Here are the major instances documented in the New Testament.",
