As Rachel had been barren for many years, Joseph's birth was a source of great joy for Jacob (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2030:22-24&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 30:22-24</a>)."

In the second dream, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to him.

        "betrayal_and_slavery": "Joseph's brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near a place called Shechem. Joseph's father Israel said to Joseph, 'As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.' 'Very well,' Joseph replied. So Israel said to him, 'Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.' Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2037:12-14&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 37:12-14</a>). </p>So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near a place called Dothan. But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them. Out of jealousy and resentment, Joseph's brothers initially plotted to kill him but then decided against it, opting instead to throw him into a pit. Eventually, they sold him into slavery to passing Ishmaelites. Joseph was then taken to Egypt and sold as a slave to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2037:15-36&version=NKJV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 37:15-36</a>).",
        "treatment_by_potiphar": "In Egypt, Joseph was sold to Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh's guard who is a high-ranking officer in charge of protecting Pharaoh and maintaining order in Egypt. Potiphar saw that the Lord was with Joseph and that he prospered in everything he did. As a result, Potiphar put him in charge of his household and entrusted him with all his possessions. Joseph managed Potiphar's household efficiently, and the Lord blessed the household because of Joseph (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2039:1-6&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 39:1-6</a>).",
        "false_accusation_and_imprisonment": "Joseph was well-built and handsome, and Potiphar's wife took notice of him. She tried to seduce him, but Joseph consistently refused her advances, citing his loyalty to Potiphar and his fear of God. Angered by his rejection, Potiphar's wife falsely accused Joseph of trying to sexually assault her. Potiphar was enraged and had Joseph thrown into prison (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2039:6-20&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 39:6-20</a>).",
        "life_in_prison": "Even in prison, the Lord was with Joseph and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden. The warden put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners and made him responsible for all that was done there. Joseph's leadership and integrity were evident, and he continued to prosper, even in confinement (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2039:21-23&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 39:21-23</a>).",
        "interpretation_of_dreams": "While in prison, Joseph interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh's chief cupbearer and chief baker, who had been imprisoned with him. The chief cupbearer's dream involved a vine with three branches that blossomed and produced grapes, which he pressed into Pharaoh's cup. Joseph interpreted this as meaning that in three days, the cupbearer would be restored to his position. The chief baker's dream involved three baskets of bread on his head, with birds eating from the top basket. Joseph interpreted this as meaning that in three days, the baker would be executed. Both interpretations came to pass as Joseph had said but Joseph remained in prison (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2040&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 40</a>). <p></p>Two years later, Pharaoh had two troubling dreams that no one could interpret. The cupbearer remembered Joseph and recommended him to Pharaoh. Joseph was brought from prison to interpret Pharaoh's dreams. He explained that the dreams predicted seven years of abundance followed by seven years of severe famine. Joseph advised Pharaoh to store surplus grain during the years of abundance to prepare for the famine.

        "rise_to_power": "After interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, Pharaoh, impressed by Joseph's wisdom, appointed him as governor over all Egypt, second only to Pharaoh himself. As governor, Joseph oversaw the collection and storage of grain during the seven years of abundance. (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2041&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 41</a>).<p></p>As governor, Joseph not only saved Egypt from famine but also increased Pharaoh's wealth and power by acquiring land and livestock in exchange for grain during the famine (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2047:13-26&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 47:13-26</a>).",
        "reunion_with_family": "When the famine struck, people from all over the world came to Egypt to buy grain. Joseph's brothers also came to buy grain, not recognizing him. After testing their integrity, Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers and forgave them. He invited his entire family to live in Egypt, where they were provided for during the famine (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2041:41-57&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 41:41-57</a>; <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2042-45&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 42-45</a>).",
        "josephs_children": "Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, born to him by Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. Manasseh's name means 'causing to forget,' as Joseph said, 'God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household.' Ephraim's name means 'fruitful,' as Joseph said, 'God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering' (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2041:50-52&version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 41:50-52</a>).",

        "end_of_life": "Joseph remained in Egypt with his entire family and lived to the age of 110. Before his death, he reassured his brothers of his forgiveness and the divine plan, urging them to promise to carry his bones out of Egypt to the land promised to their forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Upon his death, Joseph's body was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt (<a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2050:22-26&version=NIV' target='_blank'>Genesis 50:22-26</a>).<p></p>When the children of Israel eventually moved out of Egypt, they carried Joseph's bones with them, as Joseph had made them to promise (<a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2013%3A19&version=NIV' target='_blank'>Exodus 13:19</a>). Joseph's bones were eventually buried at Shechem in Canaan, in the land bought by his father Jacob (<a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2024%3A32&version=NIV' target='_blank'>Joshua 24:32</a>).",
